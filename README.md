# Sample App: Marko + Koa + Lasso

This sample app illustrates how to integrate Marko with a very basic Koa app.
For this sample app, we use the streaming API to stream the output of the
template rendering to the HTTP response stream. In addition, this sample
application illustrates how to create custom tags that can be embedded into your
templates.
